## [Slackline MTL](https://www.slacklinemtl.com/)
{{< project-info

This is a Shopify store with a custom front-end built with Gatsby, Tailwind CSS and DatoCMS.
I highly recommend you start slacklining. Today!

## [Simple Timeline](https://www.simple-timeline.com/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="simple_timeline.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="simple_timeline.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Simple Timeline"
    status="MVP available, kinda actively maintained 🏚" 
    kindOfProject="Webapp,SAAS"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/nicetimeline"
>}}

Simple Timeline is - and I quote myself - "a tool to visualize the passing of time".

The older I get, the harder it is to remember where I was X years ago. This tool remembers the exact dates for me. It's a great way to reflect on the past. A great complement to a diary. It's also free to use.

## [Artsy Hams](https://boutique.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="artsy_hams.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="artsy_hams.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Artsy Hams"
    status="Never-ending 🎨" 
    kindOfProject="Art,E-commerce"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/free-ecom"
>}}

When it comes to visual art, I was born gifted. Everything is sold out, of course, but you can still marvel at my famous paintings.

I did write a blog post about the tech behind the store: [My Recipe for a 0$/month e-commerce Website](/posts/my-recipe-for-a-0-dollar-per-month-e-commerce-website/)

## [Daily Cartoons](https://github.com/FelDev/daily-cartoons)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="daily_cartoons.webp"
    fallbackSrc="daily_cartoons.png"
    alt="Screenshot of the Daily Cartoons email"
    status="Done ✅" 
    kindOfProject="Web Scrapping,Fun"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/daily-cartoons"
>}}

Web scraping script running daily. It emails me political cartoons from a bunch of newspapers, plus [XKCD cartoons](https://xkcd.com/). Simple and fun. Almost a SaaS...

## [Ask Sagan](https://v2.felixparadis.com/ask-sagan/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="ask_sagan.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="ask_sagan.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Ask Sagan"

What if Carl Sagan himself could answer your questions? Just fill the text box and press <kbd>enter</kbd> .

## [Photography 365](https://365.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="365.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="365.png"
    alt="Screenshot of 365.felixparadis.com"
    status="Done ✅" 
    kindOfProject="Art"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/365"
    lazy="true"
>}}

A photography project I did during my gap year in 2012-2013. The challenge was to take a (good) picture everyday for a year.

## [Morem](https://morem.netlify.app/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="morem.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="morem.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Morem"
    status="Abandoned 🏚" 
    kindOfProject="Webapp,PWA"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/morem"
    lazy="true"
>}}

Morem is for **MORE M**editation. I learned about Progressive Web Apps, got excited and decided to make a meditation timer that increases itself everyday. It was fun and got to the MVP stage, but I ended up bumping into limitations of PWAs (Looking at you, Screen Wake Lock API.) and lost interest.

## [The First Version of this Website](https://v1.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="v1.felixparadis.com.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="v1.felixparadis.com.png"
    alt="Screenshot of v1.felixparadis.com"
    status="Done ✅" 
    kindOfProject="Website,Joke"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/felixparadis.com-v1"
    lazy="true"
>}}

A single index.html file! It sure is fast to load and contains a fun easter egg and a half 🥚

<br/>

## [The Second Version of this Website](https://v2.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info
    webpSrc="v2.felixparadis.com.webp" 
    fallbackSrc="v2.felixparadis.com.png"
    alt="Screenshot of v2.felixparadis.com"
    status="Done ✅" 
    kindOfProject="Website"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/felixparadis.com-v2"
    lazy="true"
>}}

I challenged myself to build the second version with nothing but pure HTML, CSS and JS. No framework, no librairies. It's fairly simple, but has light and dark mode + instant language switching.
