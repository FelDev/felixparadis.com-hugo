This is - and I quote myself - "A tool to visualize the passing of time".

The older I get, the harder it is to remember where I was X years ago. This tool remembers the exact dates for me. It's a great way to reflect on the past. A great complement to a diary. It's also free to use.

When it comes to visual art, I was born gifted. Everything is sold out, of course, but you can still marvel at my famous paintings.

I did write a blog post about the tech behind the store: [My Recipe for a 0$/month e-commerce Website](/posts/my-recipe-for-a-0-dollar-per-month-e-commerce-website/)

What if Carl Sagan himself could answer your questions? Just fill the text box and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

## [Photography 365](https://365.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info

A photography project I did during my gap year in 2012-2013. The challenge was to take a (good) picture everyday for a year.

## [Morem](https://morem.netlify.app/)
{{< project-info
    status="Abandoned 🏚" 
    kindOfProject="Webapp,PWA"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/morem"

Morem is for **MORE M**editation. I learned about Progressive Web Apps, got excited and decided to make a meditation timer that increases itself everyday. It was fun and got to the MVP stage, but I ended up bumping into limitations of PWA (Looking at you, Screen Wake Lock API.) and lost interest.

## [The First Version of this Website](https://v1.felixparadis.com/)

A single index.html file! It sure is fast to load and contains a fun easter egg and a half 🥚

## [The Second Version of this Website](https://v2.felixparadis.com/)
{{< project-info
    status="Done ✅" 
    kindOfProject="Website"
    openSourceRepo="https://github.com/FelDev/felixparadis.com-v2"
>}}

I challenged myself to build the second version with nothing but pure HTML, CSS and JS. No framework, no librairies. It's fairly simple, but has light and dark mode + instant language switching.
