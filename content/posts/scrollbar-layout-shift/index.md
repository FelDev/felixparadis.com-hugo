Here is the situation: 
You need to prevent scrolling on you main content when a certain element becomes visible.
Probably a modal[^1] or a sliding burger menu.

You easily achieve this by setting `overflow:hidden;` on the element which must be temporarily
**un**scrollable, probably the `<body>`.

But now you have an unpleasant visual effect, demonstrated in the CodePen below:

{{< codepen id="NWXjrzw" >}}

As you can see*, the content behind the modal is shifting.
This happens because when we set `overflow:hidden` on the `<body>`,
the scrollbar disapears and the content adjusts to a new width.
(A new `document.body.clientWidth`, to be exact.)

*If you cannot see it, scrollbars must be automatically hidden by your OS.
The setting looks like this on Mac and must be equally easy on Linux and Windows.

## Prevent content shifting by replacing the scrollbar with padding

Simply add padding as wide as the scrollbar before it disapears and
remove that padding when the modal gets closed. ðŸª„

There is no such thing as `document.getScrollbarWidth` and scrollbars are not all 
created equal; 15px wide on Chrome, 12px on Edge, 0px on my phone...
But you can get the scrollbar width easily with this single line of JS:

```js
// For a live demo, copy and paste this in the console
window.innerWidth - document.body.clientWidth
```

With that precious information, all that's left to do is set a padding on the body.

```js
// on open
document.body.style.paddingRight = `${
  window.innerWidth - document.body.clientWidth
}px`
document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'

// on close
document.body.style.paddingRight = '0'
document.body.style.overflow = 'unset'
```

And our modal can now open gracefully, without any nonsense in the background:

{{< codepen id="GRymqWo" >}}

Don't bother looking at the HTML and CSS of these CodePens, the magic happens in the
`openModal` and `closeModal` functions.



[^1]: ["modal", "dialog", "popup", "popover"...](https://ux.stackexchange.com/q/90336) I'll stick to "modal" here.
