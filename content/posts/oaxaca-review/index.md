## Nice things about Oaxaca

### 1. The food

A lot of restaurants serve more or less what every other restaurant and street
food vendor in Mexico sells; tacos, memelitas, quesadillas, etc...
But there is a wide variety of food in the city.
Cool caf√©s abound, the <span lang="es">chocolate de agua y chocolate de leche</span>
are delicious. 
There's just a lot to see and taste here.

Go get an <span lang="es">Orgasmo de chocolate</span> at La Jicara and thank me later.

Go get the fanciest meal of your life at Criollo and apologize to your wallet later.

### 2. The people

Probably true of Mexico in general, people are very nice and friendly.
Sure, there's a slim chance of getting mugged and that might change your 
perspective on the good people of Oaxaca, but in my experience Oaxacans are
very welcoming, you can make friends with locals easily and vendors don't try 
to screw you over.

### 3. The internet speeds

You may not get 300 mb/s in every cheap hostel, but if you look for fast
wifi, you will find fast wifi.

I've worked at Convivio a ton, but we also had a decent setup and around 100 mb/s at
an appartment we rented.

### 4. Lots of day trips and weekend trips

Oaxaca de Juarez itself has a lot to offer, but don't stick to the city!
We've booked a one-day climbing trip with [#TODO] (), a one-day caving trip at San Sebastian de Las Grutas, a one-day biking trip with [#TODO]. 

We've also been hiking for free with people met through facebook groups. 
Self-organized a weekend at San Jose del Pacifico with another travelling couple and a Oaxaca local.
(Highly recommend, do try the Temazcal and the local delicacy üçÑ)

### 5. Good expat community

There are lots of remote workers and travellers in Oaxaca, but not so much that
you feel like you are on a resort.

We easily found a cool language exchange night, a coworking group and a 
"let's do fun things" group. Whatsapp groups are popular. 


## Downsides of Oaxaca

### 1. The sidewalks.

Really. Life as a pedestrian in Oaxaca is not easy.
Drivers are not *that* disrespectful, but when it comes to sidewalks...
I think these 2 pictures sum it up:

If you go around in a wheelchair, prepare to become a whole lot more disabled.

### 2. ¬°La fiesta! Whether you like it or not.

How about a party? No?
Well, too bad, because your neighbors feel like partying and whether it's 2pm on
a Saturday or 2am on a Tuesday doesn't seem to matter at all.

This is true for Mexico in general, I'm being told.
So don't go and complain like you're home, you're a guest, buddy.

### 3. Fireworks and noise in general

Related to the previous point, being annoyingly noisy is socially acceptable in 
Oaxaca.
Vendors going down the streets with speakers are not that annoying to me.
But the daytime fireworks...
Oaxacans will shoot "Mexican fireworks" for any sort of special occasion.
A birthday, wedding, holiday, celebration of a saint or perhaps just because hey why not?
A "Mexican Fireworks" is basically just a loud Bang.
They literraly sound like bombs.
Not super duper cool for your online meetings, but there's 
[an interesting story behind it](https://weexpats.com/mexicans-light-fireworks-day-long/).
The other common annoyance are dogs.
Some Mexicans let their dog bark and whine all-day long. 
Almost seems like animal cruelty to me, but it's just plain normal around here.

## San Cristobal de las Casas

About ameoba, symptoms begin to appear in about one to four weeks after ingestion of the cysts.
Sounds like I got it in San Cristobal


## "Developing countries" aren't the best to live in

A big part of *digital nomading* is geo-arbitrage; earn a first-world income and spend it in a 
place with a low cost of living.
It's great to go to go the restaurants everyday because it's cheaper than making your groceries
at home, but places with a lower cost of living tend to come with a few inconveniences too.

Things I missed from my beloved Qu√©bec:

- Drinking water from tap, without the shadow of a worry.
- Feeling safe everywhere, even in the darkest alleys of Montr√©al.
- Things and people being organi <!-- // wut? -->
