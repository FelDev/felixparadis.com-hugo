Gatsby is great! 
But every now and then it throws a weird, unhelpful error
message my way.

So, here is a collection of weird errors and the solutions I found (collection of one, to start ðŸ™„).
For future-me and, perhaps, present-you.

## The result of this StaticQuery could not be fetched...

> The result of this StaticQuery could not be fetched. This is likely a bug in Gatsby and if refreshing the page does not fix it, please open an issue in https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues

There are many possible reasons for this error to pop.
It seems to pop whenever anything goes wrong and usually has nothing to do with the error message ðŸ¤·

Here are two possible reasons:

### Having multiple static queries in a single file.

As stated [in the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/use-static-query/#known-limitations)

> Because of how queries currently work in Gatsby, we support only a single instance of useStaticQuery in a file

If you can't merge all queries into one, a simple solution is to extract the extra query in a component.

### Using a filter AND not using edges

No idea why, but on one of my collections, this works fine:
```gql
allFoo(filter: { language: { eq: "fr" } }) {
  nodes {
    foo
    bar
  }
}
```

While it fails on another unless I change it to this:
```gql
allFoo(filter: { language: { eq: "fr" } }) {
  edges {
    node {
      foo
      bar
    }
  }
}
```
