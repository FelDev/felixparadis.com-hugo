Gatsby is great! 
But every now and then it throws a weird, unhelpful error
message my way.

So, here is a collection of weird errors and the solutions I found (collection of one, to start ðŸ™„).
For future-me and, perhaps, present-you.

## The result of this StaticQuery could not be fetched...

There are many possible reasons for this error to pop.
It seems to pop whenever anything goes wrong and usually has nothing to do with the error message ðŸ¤·

Here are three possible reasons:

### Having multiple static queries in a single file.

As stated [in the Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/querying-data/use-static-query/#known-limitations)

> Because of how queries currently work in Gatsby, we support only a single instance of useStaticQuery in a file

If you can't merge all queries into one, a simple solution is to extract the extra query in a component.

### Using a filter AND not using edges

Not sure why, but on one of my collections, this works fine:
```gql
allFoo(filter: { language: { eq: "fr" } }) {
  nodes {
    foo
    bar
  }
}
```

While it fails on another unless I change it to this:
```gql
allFoo(filter: { language: { eq: "fr" } }) {
  edges {
    node {
      foo
      bar
    }
  }
}
```
### Changing the name of your query

While refactoring, I changed one of my static query's name. 

Something like going from:

```gql
const { allMenus } = useStaticQuery(
  graphql`
    query FooQueryName {
    allMenus(
```
to:
```gql
const { allMenus } = useStaticQuery(
  graphql`
    query BarQueryName {
    allMenus(
```

And that was a no-go for gatsby.
Restarting the development server wasn't enough, I had to run `gatsby clean` too.
